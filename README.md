# EFK Stack Deployment in the Cloud

This README provides instructions on deploying the EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) stack in the k8s cloud. The EFK stack is used for log and event data collection, storage, and visualization.

1. Elasticsearch: This is a distributed search and analytics engine. It's used for storing and searching large volumes of data quickly. In the context of EFK, Elasticsearch is typically used to store log and event data.

2. Fluentd: Fluentd is an open-source data collector. It's responsible for gathering log data from various sources, processing it, and forwarding it to Elasticsearch for storage. Fluentd is highly configurable and can handle data 
   from a wide range of inputs.

3. Kibana: Kibana is a data visualization and exploration tool. It provides a web-based interface for users to search, analyze, and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch. Users can create dashboards, charts, and graphs to gain 
   insights into their log and event data.

EFK is commonly used in DevOps and IT operations to monitor and analyze logs from various applications and systems. It helps organizations troubleshoot issues, track system 
performance, and detect anomalies by providing a centralized platform for log management and analysis. 


Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [Cloud Provider Account]: You will need an account with your chosen cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy the EFK stack in the cloud:

Step 1: Provision Infrastructure

1. Launch the necessary virtual machines (VMs) or cloud instances using your cloud provider's dashboard or command-line tools.
2. Ensure that the VMs have the required resources (CPU, RAM, storage) based on your expected log volume.
3. Install helm in your machine through where you have access to your cloud cluster

Step 2: Apply the EFK tar file through the helm command in your Cloud Provider k8s cluster.
   ``` helm install <release name> <.tar file> ```
